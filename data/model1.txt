Method
Research Design
This research was conducted using a cross-sectional survey design from quantitative research methods. The network psychometry approach was adopted in the study, and relationships among variables were examined through network analysis. This design allows for the examination of complex interrelationships among multiple variables simultaneously and provides insights into the dynamic structure of psychological constructs.
Participants
The study included Turkish women participants. The inclusion criteria specified female gender and Turkish nationality. Demographic information including age was collected as control variables to examine potential confounding effects.
Variables
The variables used in the research are as follows:
Independent Variables:
* Cybervictimization (CV): Measured using 10 items assessing various forms of online victimization experiences
* Shame: Measured using 5 items (items 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 from the Shame and Guilt Scale)
* Guilt: Measured using 5 items (items 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 from the Shame and Guilt Scale)
* Self-Compassion (SC): Measured using 10 items from the Self-Compassion Scale
* Social Media Addiction (SMA): Measured using the 6-item Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale
* Family Social Support: Measured using 4 items (items 1-4 from the Social Support Scale)
* Friend Social Support: Measured using 4 items (items 5-8 from the Social Support Scale)
* Social Media Usage Time: Categorical variable (1: Less than 1 hour, 2: 1-2 hours, 3: 3-4 hours, 4: 5-6 hours, 5: More than 6 hours)
* Social Media Interaction Types: Measured on a 5-point scale (1: Never, 2: Rarely, 3: Sometimes, 4: Often, 5: Always) including: 
o Passive Use
o Active Sharing
o Content Creation
o Content Consumption
Dependent Variables:
* Depression: DASS-21 subscale (7 items: 3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, 21)
* Anxiety: DASS-21 subscale (7 items: 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, 20)
* Stress: DASS-21 subscale (7 items: 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18)
Control Variables:
* Age (continuous variable)
* Gender (categorical variable: Male, Female) - used for group comparisons
Measures
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The DASS-21 was used to measure psychological distress levels. The scale consists of 21 items and has three subscales (depression, anxiety, stress), with each subscale containing 7 items. Items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much or most of the time).
Self-Compassion Scale. The 10-item Self-Compassion Scale was used to measure participants' self-compassion levels. The scale assesses the capacity to be kind, understanding, and non-judgmental toward oneself during difficult times.
Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale. The 6-item Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale was used to evaluate social media addiction levels. The scale measures problematic social media use patterns including mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse.
Social Support Scale. The 8-item Social Support Scale was used to measure family (4 items) and friend (4 items) social support. The scale assesses perceived availability and adequacy of social support from different sources.
Shame and Guilt Scale. The 11-item Shame and Guilt Scale was used to evaluate shame (5 items) and guilt (5 items) levels. The scale distinguishes between these two self-conscious emotions and their respective impacts on psychological well-being.
Cybervictimization Scale. The 10-item Cybervictimization Scale was used to measure cybervictimization experiences. The scale assesses various forms of online victimization including harassment, exclusion, and threatening behaviors.
Social Media Usage Form. Information about social media usage time and interaction types (passive use, active sharing, content creation, content consumption) was collected using a custom-developed form.
